Crying or Very sad I suppose there are some places they're determined to blast no matter the day or night. Please just stay safe and be well, everyday, and everyone!  Smile After a three day reprieve (while they pounded the Pacific Northwest), the chemtrail spray program has returned with a vengence today. The spray operation was already well underway by 9:00 this morning. I posted ten photos to my Webshots album Same here today. They were very busy laying in the trails in parallel lines, cross overs, spreading out into thin veils and feathers. I was finishing up shopping just after sunset and there were several fresh trails in the twilight sky. I would hate for some parent to tell their kids that's Santa up in the sky tonight seeing the trails.  Crying or Very sad The largest number of reports seems to be from the US, followed by Canada. Several other countries have some reports, often noted by western visitors. Since reports are coming from multiple countries, it seems to transcend individual governments. But with no obvious controlling body the answer remains to be seen.";
